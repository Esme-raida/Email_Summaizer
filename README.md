# 📧 Email Summarizer Project

A collaborative NLP project that automatically summarizes long emails into short, meaningful summaries. This project involves collecting, cleaning, and processing email data using Python, and building a user interface using GUI -- TKINTER.

## 💡 Project Overview

This Email Summarizer helps users quickly understand the key points of lengthy emails by generating concise summaries. It uses *extractive summarization techniques* to identify and select the most important sentences from the email body.

The project is split into 5 main roles:
1. *Data Collection & Cleaning*
2. *Text Preprocessing & Feature Extraction*
3. *Extractive Summarization (TF-IDF / Frequency-based)*
4. *Evaluation of Summary Quality*
5. *Frontend Interface (Streamlit App)*
