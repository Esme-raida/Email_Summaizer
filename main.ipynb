Was the baby shower fun?\\n\\n   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago\\n   essays\\n   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if\\n   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your\\n   home\\n   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so\\n   tonight).\\n\\n   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained\\n   a\\n   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty\\n   frustrated\\n   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday\\n   telling\\n   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk\\n   /\\n   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's\\n   afraid\\n   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --\\n   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.\\n\\n   Livia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\\nthe intended recipient (s).

I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland. We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement. Please contact me at [PHONE] or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns.

I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland. We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement. Please contact me at [PHONE] or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns.
