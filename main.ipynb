Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\\n</td>\n",

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\\n  \n",

Was the baby shower fun?\\n\\n   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago\\n   essays\\n   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if\\n   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your\\n   home\\n   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so\\n   tonight).\\n\\n   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained\\n   a\\n   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty\\n   frustrated\\n   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday\\n   telling\\n   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk\\n   /\\n   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's\\n   afraid\\n   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --\\n   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.\\n\\n   Livia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\\nthe intended recipient (s).

Let me know if\\n   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your\\n   home\\n   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so\\n   tonight).\\n\\n   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained\\n   a\\n   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty\\n   frustrated\\n   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday\\n   telling\\n   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk\\n   /\\n   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's\\n   afraid\\n   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --\\n   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.\\n\\n   Livia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\\nthe intended recipient (s).

I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland. We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement. Please contact me at [PHONE] or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns.

I am coordinating with the Lender regarding the reimbursement provisions in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement from Ryland. We may do a separate agreement between you, AMHP and McCall in the event Agape fails to receive reimbursement. Please contact me at [PHONE] or Michael Bobinchuck with any questions or concerns.
